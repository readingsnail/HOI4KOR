HUN_council_of_peoples_commissars코0=Council of People's Commissars
HUN_council_of_peoples_commissars_desc코0=A governing body must be created that can oversee the transition of Hungary into a communist state. Once this has been done, this Council will serve as the analogue to the Western system of a cabinet formed by ministers.
HUN_the_hungarian_red_army코0=The Hungarian Red Army

HUN_pressure_romania코0=Pressure Romania
HUN_pressure_romania_desc코0=As we focus on the Fascist danger in the West, we cannot allow a potential threat to continue to exist in our rear, especially not when it lies between ourselves and our allies to the East.

HUN_intervene_in_czechoslovakia코0=Intervene In Czechoslovakia
HUN_intervene_in_czechoslovakia_desc코0=The Czechoslovaks have been awarded some of the territories taken from us in the Treaty of Trianon.

ROM_secure_the_bosporus_desc코0=Our naval access is, for now, limited to the Black Sea. Turkey, straddling the Bosporus Strait, could block our access to the mediterranean in the case of war, and so we must ensure free passage for when we have need of it.

ROM_all_parties_must_end_desc코0=No party lasts forever, and the current geopolitical situation requires our King's undivided attention. He may throw one cracker of a party once the war is over, but for now he must leave his hedonistic ways behind him.

ROM_force_abdication코0=Force Abdication
ROM_force_abdication_desc코0=King Carol II is no longer required, and, indeed, is proving to be more of a hassle than a leader. Though he still has extensive control over the nation's government and finances, he must be made to abdicate for the long-term good of Romania.
ROM_appoint_allied_friendly_government코1=Appoint Pro-Allied Government

ROM_nuclear_bomb_project코0=Nuclear Bomb Project
ROM_nuclear_bomb_project_desc코0=We can never hope to out-bomb our likely enemies via conventional means. We must therefore focus on technological advances that will allow us to achieve more destruction with less. Much, much more.
ROM_iar_80코0=IAR 80
ROM_iar_80_desc코0=Our engineers have excellent ideas that they are eager to pour into a new fighter design. They merely need funding and the go-ahead.

ROM_acquire_modern_tanks_desc코0=The development of tanks continues at a rapid pace, and it will not do to acquire obsolete models.
ROM_mobile_tank_destroyers코0=Mobile Tank Destroyers
ROM_mobile_tank_destroyers_desc코0=We do not possess the industry to out-produce our enemies in terms of tanks. We must instead focus on producing weapons that can nullify the enemy's superiority in armored units.
ROM_the_maresal코0=The Maresal
ROM_the_maresal_desc코0=Our engineers have come up with an idea to place a Soviet 122mm howitzer in an enclosed casemate. By further refining this design, we may well be on our way to create a highly-successful tank model.

ROM_torpedo_boats코0=Torpedo Boats

ROM_modern_submarines코0=Modern Submarines
ROM_modern_submarines_desc코0=Submarine warfare is the most exciting naval development since the invention of the torpedo boat. We would do well to not just protect against submarines, but also use them against enemy shipping.
ROM_black_sea_dominance코0=Black Sea Dominance
ROM_black_sea_dominance_desc코0=Our initial lack of resources should be no impediment to future total Romanian dominance of the Black Sea. With appropriate political will, we will make this a reality.

ROM_torpedo_bombers코0=Torpedo Bombers
ROM_torpedo_bombers_desc코0=We can make up our naval weakness by appropriating a portion of our air forces to naval duties. This will require a new airplane model that can carry a torpedo.

The French have recently constructed an incredible fortified line of their own, the Maginot Line, and by sending a delegation to study their methods it should be possible to solve our own border defense problems.
CZE_fallback_line코0=Fallback Line
CZE_fallback_line_desc코0=If the border cannot be held, it would be well to have a second line of fortification to fall back on before any attack from the west can reach our heartland.
CZE_sudeten_1코0=Sudetenland Early Fortifications
CZE_sudeten_1_desc코0=The Sudetenland, our mountainous border with Germany, is the perfect place for border fortifications. Having studied the French Maginot line, we can build a similar line of our own.
CZE_sudeten_2코0=Sudetenland Advanced Fortifications
CZE_sudeten_2_desc코0=The Sudetenland now boasts a decent defensive line, but decent is not good enough when our national survival is at stake.
CZE_sudeten_3코0=Sudetenland Final Fortifications

CZE_favor_czechs_1코0=Czech Industry
CZE_favor_czechs_1_desc코0=There has always been tension between the Czechs and Slovaks within our nation, not least because much of our industrial power is concentrated in the Czech provinces of Bohemia and Moravia.

CZE_favor_czechs_2코1=Industrial Heartlands
CZE_favor_czechs_2_desc코1=Further investment focused into Bohemia and Moravia will improve our industry far more than a broader approach.

CZE_arms_exports_3_desc코1=Demand for weapons is at an all-time high, and so is the output of our production lines. To support weapon sales, we can publically declare that we will sell to anyone with the cash to pay for it - and then use the money to invest in our own rearmament.

CZE_the_polish_division_desc코0=Not only does Poland refuse the passage of Soviet troops in the event we need their help, they still harbor resentment over our liberation of the Zaolzie region and may well seek revenge. A preemptive defense would be prudent.

CZE_the_polish_question코0=The Polish Question
CZE_the_polish_question_desc코0=The Poles have never forgiven us for Zaolzie, and if we show any weakness they will undoubtedly pounce. Why should a great nation such as Czechoslovakia suffer under this kind of threat? No More! Decisive action must be taken!
CZE_exclude_the_slovaks코0=Czech Consolidation
CZE_exclude_the_slovaks_desc코1=From the day our country was formed, the Slovaks have been discontent.

CZE_strategy_decisions코0=Strategic Decisions
CZE_strategy_decisions_desc코0=A storm is gathering over Europe, the threat of war looms, but how shall Czechoslovakia meet the challenges ahead?
CZE_german_leanings코0=German Appeasement
CZE_german_leanings_desc코0=German power is on the rise, and their stated goal is to unite all German-speaking people within one Reich. As a nation with a sizable German minority, these are worrying developments. Unless we can secure powerful allies of our own we may benefit from staying in Germany's good graces.
CZE_german_puppet코0=German Puppet
CZE_german_puppet_desc코0=Germany cannot be appeased, they will not stop until they rule over us. And yet, perhaps by bending the knee we can preserve some autonomy?

CZE_doctrinal_innovation_desc코0=We have learned much from officer exchanges and strategy sessions with our allies. Combining such disparate points of view has put us on the edge of a breakthrough.
