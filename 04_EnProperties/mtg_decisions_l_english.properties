HOL_relocate_government_to_batavia코0=Relocate Government to Batavia
HOL_relocate_government_to_batavia_desc코0=Our mainland has been overrun, but our colonies lie untouched. Though it goes against the wishes of the Queen, we can relocate our government to Batavia, the capital of the East Indies, and continue the war effort from there.
