gw_tank_equipment_desc코0=Tanks in World War I were developed separately and simultaneously by the United Kingdom and France as a means to break the deadlock of trench warfare on the Western Front. The name Tank was adopted by the British during the early stages of their development, as a security measure to conceal their purpose. Early tanks were armed with machineguns and small cannons, moved slowly, and were armored only enough to stop small arms fire.

The first one eventually became known as Panzerkampfwagen III, which was to be a standard tank for the three light companies of a tank battalion. The second one became known as Panzerkampfwagen IV.

While never replacing the latter, it served alongside it and the heavier Tiger tanks until the end of the war. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tanks of World War II.
