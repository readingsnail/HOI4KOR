SCREENING_BOX_TOOLTIP코0=The §YScreening Group§! holds all the screening ships - usually Light Cruisers and Destroyers - tasked with keeping enemy screening ships away from the main §YBattleline§!. Insufficient screening will allow enemy screens to make torpedo attacks against the battleline.

Screened from the enemy by both the §YScreening Group§! and the §YBattleline§!, the carriers can launch strikes on the enemy without interference. Should any §YConvoys§! be present in the battle, they will also appear in this area.
SUBMARINE_BOX_TOOLTIP코0=The §YSubmarine Wolfpack§! will attempt to finish off fleeing ships with its torpedoes while remaining hidden. A lack of dedicated anti-submarine vessels amongst the enemy will allow the submarines to slip away undetected.
